## üõ°Ô∏è Data Privacy and Security

### Data Handling

The WFRMLS Python client:

- **Does not store** your API credentials (except in memory during requests)
- **Does not log** sensitive information by default
- **Does not transmit** data to third parties
- **Uses HTTPS** for all API communications

### Your Privacy Obligations

When building applications with this client:

- **Protect user data** according to applicable privacy laws
- **Secure API credentials** - never expose them publicly
- **Handle personal information** (agent contacts, etc.) appropriately
- **Implement proper access controls** for sensitive data

### Security Best Practices

```python
import os
import logging

# ‚úÖ Good: Secure credential management
def create_client():
    token = os.getenv('WFRMLS_BEARER_TOKEN')
    if not token:
        raise ValueError("API token required")
    return WFRMLSClient(bearer_token=token)

# ‚úÖ Good: Avoid logging sensitive data
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def safe_log_property(prop):
    logger.info(f"Processing property {prop.get('ListingId', 'unknown')}")
    # Don't log full property details that might contain sensitive info

# ‚ùå Bad: Never do this
# token = "9d0243d7632d115b002acf3547d2d7ee"  # Hardcoded token
# logger.info(f"Using token: {token}")        # Logging credentials
```
